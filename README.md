# Alfie codebase
The old_versions folder is for older versions of alfie code.\
Any other folder is current code.\
Please name code based on what parts they are for. Example, LeftRightArmV1.ino, HeadV1.ino\
Arduino .ino code requires itself to be in a folder of the same name so that's why the commit history is weird I also barely know how to use github.
